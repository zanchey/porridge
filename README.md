# My Health Record Organisational Audit Tool (MHROAT)

Monitor your organisation's use of the My Health Record.

## Purpose

Many clinical information systems allow you to interact with the [My Health Record](https://www.myhealthrecord.gov.au/), but very few provide an acceptable audit trail for ensuring compliance with legislation and policy. Some systems expose the audit view incompletely, others allow modification of their internal logs, and still others provide no insightâ€”requiring you to make time-consuming requests to the My Health Record system operator.

MHROAT is designed to be used by Responsible Officers (ROs) and their delegates, such as IT administrators, to access the audit records stored within the My Health Record system, including data such as who accessed a record, what documents they read and what changes were made.

This tool is not for patients (who should use the My Health Record website's Record Access History function) or individual healthcare providers (who should ask their My Health Record administrator or Responsible Officer for this information).

## Usage

### Graphical interface

To start the graphical interface, download and run the "MHROAT" file for your platform (Windows or macOS).

You will need to supply a HPI-O certificate file and its password, the dates and times to include audit records, and an output CSV file.

The password for the certificate is saved in the operating system's secure storage by default. Uncheck the "Save password" option to disable this.

### Command-line interface

MHROAT can be used from the command-line, and supports use in scripts.

On Windows, download and run the `mhroatc.exe` file. On macOS, run `MHROAT.app/Contents/MacOS/MHROAT`.

The command-line usage is summarised below.

```
usage: mhroat [-h] -c CERT_FILE [-P] [-S] [-f DATE_FROM]
              [--time-from TIME_FROM] [-t DATE_TO] [--time-to TIME_TO] -o
